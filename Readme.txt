Hello sir, 
        Hope you are fine, so I completed my coding round. Thank you for give me this opportunity to show my skills.




Route :- 

1]. index.html is HOME PAGE.
2]. This E-commerece website contains Header, slideshow, breadcrumb, grid and footer.
3]. Every button has HOVER property.
4]. I implemented all my coding stuff into fashion dropdown list. 
            fashion1.html
            fashion2.html
            fashion3.html
5]. By using javascript I used slideshow(carousel).
6]. By using javascript we can add a card on fashion1.html, fashion2.html, fashion3.html. Just you have to uncomment this items.
7]. code has split into reusable component like EXPANDABLE DROPDOWN.


                                                                                        -Thank You.
